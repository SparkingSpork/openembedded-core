Subject: [PATCH] autogen-native: fix bash shebang path length

This patch should NOT be upstreamed to OE-core and it is to be dropped
in post-Rocko releases (upstream OE removed autogen-native entirely).

NIBuild / OE builds for older NILRT fail because their shebang paths
are too long (this isn't a problem in newer NILRT because we don't use
NIBuild so it's paths are much shorter).

Fix by replacing the hardcoded script shebang path with a /usr/bin/env
runtime detected one.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [NI-specific, will be dropped post-Rocko]
